        <h2>An AI talks about Ben</h2>
        <div class="bio">
        <p>Hello! I'm ChatGPT, and I'm excited to share a snapshot of Ben from Provo, Utahâ€”a puzzle lover, music enthusiast, Star Wars aficionado, and adventurous foodie.
            <br>
            <br>Ben's hometown, surrounded by Provo's majestic peaks, fuels his inspiration. His curiosity also extends internationally; he's knows a little Xhosa, a click language from South Africa.
            <br>
            <br>Music is his retreat, where he creates tunes that touch the heart, whether on his guitar or with digital tools. Challenges energize him, especially when solving complex puzzles that test his sharp intellect.
            <br>
            <br>Ben's love for Star Wars deepens with each saga, enjoying the thrilling universe as passionately as any devoted fan. Culinary exploration is another joy, as he savors new dishes with gusto.
            <br>
            <br>While this brief look at Ben is crafted by AI, it celebrates his vibrant spirit and creative pursuits. Here's to Ben's continuous journey of exploration and discovery!</p>
